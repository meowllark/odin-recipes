    <h1>DRUNK CHICKEN</h1><br>

    <h2>Chinese Drunken Chicken</h2><br>
    <p>Chinese drunken chicken is usually an appetizer eaten cold or at room temperature and most common among Shanghai cuisine.</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>2 chicken leg quarters</li>
        <li>2.5 cups water</li>
        <li>2 large slices ginger</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1.5 cups homemade chicken broth</li>
        <li>1.5 cups shaoxing wine</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>2.5 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp dried goji berries</li>
    </ul><br><br>
    <ol>
        <li>Debone the chicken leg quarters, keeping the skin on. Keep the bones to make a homemade stock, which you’ll be using in this recipe. You might be able to ask your butcher to help you with this step!</li>
        <li>In a small pot, add your reserved chicken bones, 2 ½ cups water, and ginger. Bring to a boil and simmer over low heat for at least 1 hour (or longer). We’ll need 1 ½ cups of chicken broth for the recipe. You can also eliminate this step if you want to use store-bought chicken stock.</li>
        <li>Rinse off your de-boned chicken and pat thoroughly dry with a paper towel. Grab 2 pieces of aluminum foil, each about 12” long. Lay each piece of chicken onto a piece of foil, and sprinkle with ¼ teaspoon salt. Roll up the chicken lengthwise, and then wrap in the foil, twisting both sides to form a candy-like bundle.</li>
